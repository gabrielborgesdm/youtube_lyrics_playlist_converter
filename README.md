# youtube_lyrics_playlist_converter

I wanted to create an app that reconstructs youtube playlists exclusively with lyric versions. I needed this because when importing songs from Spotify, existing tools in the market, like Spotify Downloader, often fetch the 'Official version,' which includes additional audio elements or annotations beyond the song itself.

## Installation
Rename .env.example to .env and replace the placeholder values with your own.
Next, install and execute with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
